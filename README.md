# Hello there üëã, I'm Soulaimane ELManioui
## A full-stack software developer üê±‚Äçüíª

* I first started my coding journey in Sep 2018 when I enrolled in ISGI(Specialised Institute of Management and IT) for two years where I first learned 
the basics of algorithms, data structures and developing basic programs using both C and C++ languages during the first year.
During The second(2019/2020) I learned HTML, CSS, JS, JQ, Ajax, JSON, relational databases in SQL Server along with object oriented programming in C# and the .NET framework,
and with that I built basic CRUD [Windows Desktop applications](https://github.com/elmaniouiSoulaimane/Potion-v1.0) for a pharmacy business using :

* UML for making relational database diagrams.
* Windows Forms as dekstop apps UI library.
* C# as a backend language.
* Entity Framework as an ORM framework.
* .NET(ADO, LINQ) for connecting with the db and managing the crud operations.
* SQL Server as database management system.

With ASP.NET during that same year I made a web application as [a medium between freelance service providers and their clients](https://github.com/elmaniouiSoulaimane/Gestion-Des-Services)
using the following technologies :

* MERISE for making relational db diagrams.
* SQL Server as database management system.
* C# as a backend language.
* .NET(ASP, ADO) for connecting with the db and managing the crud operations in the back-end.
* HTML, CSS, JS & JQ for the front-end.

After I completed my second year and obtained my Associats degree I wanted to learn more about javascript so I made 
[this project](https://github.com/elmaniouiSoulaimane/Pixatopia) for learning purposes.

Afterwards I learnt OOP Native PHP. At the same time I continued my studies at FST(Faculty of Science and Technology) Settatüìç so that I can learn 
more about software engineering, and that's where I built my [project](https://github.com/elmaniouiSoulaimane/Tax-Flow-Back-end) for the local commune centers in Morocco to automate and manage taxes on uninhabited lands,
using the folowing technologies as I only developed the back-end side while my friend and classmate [Abdellah](https://github.com/KhalfiAbdellah) took in charge of the front-end and the security and role management in the backend: 

* UML for making relational database diagrams.
* SQL Server as database management system.
* JavaEE as a back-end programming language.
* Spring framework.
* REST API.

Here's my [portfolio]() where I explain every project in more details.
